            <p>
            Aussie Suburb Ranker rates suburbs across Australia on their potential for investment properties.
            Here is how the site works.
            </p>
        
        
            <p>Three factors are considered for ranking - </p>            
            <p><ul>
                <li>Population growth</li>
                <li>Hospitals</li>
                <li>Universities</li>
            </ul>
            </p>            
            <p>
                Click on the "SUBURBS" link at the top right corner of this page to view all suburbs across Australia
                and to access the search and sort features.
            </p>
            <p class="title">Search and Sort</p>
        
            <p>
                You can perform search for suburbs by price for house or unit. If you enter 400,000 and hit search,
                you will be shown all the suburbs where the median property price is within that price. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a switch on the left of the budget/price field. If the switch is to the left, search is 
                performed on median house price within the number entered. If the switch is to the right, then search
                is performed by median unit price.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can filter your results based on the state of your interest. You can also sort the suburbs based
                on their overall rank (Relevance) or based on population growth (Demographics).
            </p>
            <p class="title">Suburb Details</p>
            <p>
                Clicking on a suburb will show you the details of the suburb such as summary from Wikipedia, which hospitals
                and universities are in the suburb and what the population growth is like.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can sort and filter the results even without performing a search. The list of suburbs will include
                all suburbs in Australia. Hope you enjoy using Aussie Suburb Ranker and thank you for visiting!
